1
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:39,400
Towards the challenge, The wero. (spell it out) W. E. R. O. 

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:48,800
The old ways are over. We carry the best of them with us, now shed the useless skins, and dress ourselves anew. 

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,440
Begin the quest. Jump in the goon-gauge sisters and brothers!

4
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,760
Feet hard on the pedal. Forge ahead, but backward. 

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,520
 No! Forge ahead forward, snap off the rearview.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,320
Hellbent, hell for leather, hell of a good time.

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,600
Existence is a montage, the palimpsest drives us forward, our purpose, poised collectively,

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:28,280
optimistic as we ride the change train, the goon train, the ghost train, the present train of thought.

9
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,560
Out of the underground and into the cities and surrounding lands my heroes. Escape! 

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,720
The trains are the rhythm, the rhythm, the tool. Repetition is good. Repetition is good.

11
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,440
Let’s all hum the same tune together. Now that’s religion!

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,840
 Stay on the tracks people. The methodology is established and understood.

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:09,280
The rains are a given. Without the patter, we are lost. It too carries us.

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,920
New trace elements are in the atmosphere. Fresh pollen is in the air.  Vox Populi.

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,760
Parhelion glow lights the way.
