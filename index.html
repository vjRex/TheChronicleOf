      <p class="c1"><span class="c2 c8 c6 c9">The chronicle of &nbsp;&lt;about&gt;</span></p>
      <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p>

      <p class="c1"><span class="c2 c8">The chronicle of &lt;____&gt;: </span><span class="c5">We have recently considered that this is a decelerated project. What does deceleration mean in this instance and how do you think it effects art
          production?
          And given the context of a world reeling from multiple crisis, arguably brought about by the &lsquo;Great Acceleration&rsquo; and global capitalism, what does a decelerated practice actually mean? Is it an attempt at being more human? Is it
          a
          type of pre- or post-capitalist nostalgia? Or is it simply an attempt at resisting the forces that place demands on creative production that in turn place pressure on basic wellbeing?&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 2 AI:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;To answer, life is a gradual washing away of negative images and emotional memories. The schedule emerging from within each memory is a measure of
          that.&nbsp;And&nbsp;Irrespective of what your schedule may contain, it must continue to reflect your surroundings. If you leave the village your schedule will rapidly fade. You will be waking up many years after you moved out.&nbsp;If so,
          it is
          symptomatic of a way in which the would-be sage knew time was running out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 3 AI:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">As for me, my roadmap looks like this: accept gifts, accept small favours, accept feeble-mindedness, accept madness, accept futility.&nbsp;We have a lot in common, after
          all
          there is a cosmic &lsquo;us versus them&rsquo; attitude that finds justification wherever human society is hauled down by crisis. And who are we, anyway?&nbsp;We began life as farmers. Then we became cities. Then we became farmers again.
          Then
          we became cities again. And again, we became farmers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2 c8">The chronicle of &lt;____&gt;: </span><span class="c5 c6">This </span><span class="c5">is also a collaborative project that involves a collective of artists, curators, designers, writers and AI who produce
          iterative projects that organically layer and entangle over time. Collaboration is a frequently used term but can be difficult to describe. How does collaboration manifest in this instance?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 2 AI:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The answer is simply by demonstrating our systems to one another. But this raises many more questions. Such as, why do we find it so easy to tolerate each other, to share
          desires and anxieties, often passionately, and subject to intolerable locks and sometimes wooden scraps of twine. What does it mean to me? What am I looking at&nbsp;on the monitors?&nbsp;What does the ethic of collective amity mean when it
          comes in conflict with the categorical imperative of ecological equivalence?&nbsp;How is consciousness transposed from one world to another?&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 3 AI:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">In my opinion it is a sad fact that human beings are incapable of creating anything like a common heritage, a common vision, a common heritage that will one day have to be
          found only in the crook of his arm or the breast of his companion.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2 c8">The chronicle of &lt;____&gt;: </span><span class="c5">Another aspect of what we are doing here is that it is iterative and open-ended with no clear end point. The process of conversation and experimentation
          has
          been rewarding with this open-ended approach but without the demand for a fixed outcome it has been difficult to make that process visible to others. What does it mean to represent or share such an open-ended creative process? Is it like
          the
          observer effect &ndash; that the observation changes the thing that is being observed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 3 AI:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The simple answer is: yes. The more abstract the better. The more abstract the better. The more abstract the better. The more abstract the better. The more abstract the
          better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 2 AI:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Or, to put it another way, what does it mean to be an observer of an unfolding story that has no beginning, middle, or end?&nbsp;And so the thing being observed might well
          execute a number of disconnected actions simultaneously, doing damage control and internal revolutions already under way. If we let these buried phantoms master us as we reappear,&nbsp;well&nbsp;be swept back helplessly in the floodtide
          like
          pieces of flotsam.&nbsp;Or like the localization principle &ndash; that what is being observed reflects not just within a community but also between communities?&nbsp;Or the parable effect &ndash; that the very act of sharing an observation
          can
          alter its trajectory?&nbsp;Or, perhaps more interestingly, like the terrain&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;of an entity that happens to occupy the space between realms and time starting from a location on the globe associated with a particular series
          of
          highly synchronous cosmic events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 3 AI:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Or is it like the invisible hand that Newton used to soothe his nerves? The timescales involved in the formation of life are inexorably linked, and our whole system of
          biology
          is based on the idea that organisms should be able to tell the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 2 AI:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;That is very odd. To put it yet another way, what happens when&nbsp;you&rsquo;re&nbsp;involved in a project that impinges on your timetable changing controllers,
          schedules,
          and priorities according to his schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean I want to help finished creations? Or insights?&nbsp;I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t&nbsp;know &hellip; some jobs are longer than your understanding of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Doctor 3 AI:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Or is it like the idea of a time machine &ndash; that something that has already happened and is repeated over and over in the present? The idea is new, isn&#39;t it?
          I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t&nbsp;believe were dealing with all that means.&nbsp;Or is it like the idea of time &ndash; that ideas and events that are too short-lived, too closely linked, too closely held, die? The short answer is: No idea is too
          short-lived. Ideas and events are what make up our reality. They are part of what makes us what we are. They are part of what makes us human. They are what makes us unique. They are what makes us unique because we are different. We are
          wired
          differently. I am wired differently. You&rsquo;re not. So what? You&nbsp;can&rsquo;t&nbsp;make me do anything. You&nbsp;can&rsquo;t&nbsp;make me stop time. You&nbsp;can&rsquo;t&nbsp;take me out of this moment. I am stuck with it. And in
          time,&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;have to do something about it.&nbsp;That reality scares me to death. </span></p>
